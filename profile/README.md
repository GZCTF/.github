## What is GZCTF?

The GZCTF project is an open source CTF platform based on ASP.NET Core. You can view the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/GZTimeWalker/GZCTF).

Due to historical reasons and the fact that GitHub organizations don't have the same amount of resources as individual accounts, the main project will not be migrated to this organization.

This organization is mainly used to manage affiliated projects and provide a platform for community members to share their projects.
